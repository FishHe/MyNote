	abstract = {We present a novel multi-view reconstruction approach that eï¬ectively combines stereo and shape-from-shading energies into a single optimization scheme. Our method uses image gradients to transition between stereo-matching (which is more accurate at large gradients) and Lambertian shape-from-shading (which is more robust in ï¬at regions). In addition, we show that our formulation is invariant to spatially varying albedo without explicitly modeling it. We show that the resulting energy function can be optimized eï¬ciently using a smooth surface representation based on bicubic patches, and demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms both previous multi-view stereo algorithms and shading based reï¬nement approaches on a number of datasets.},
